# ZenML 


ZenML is an open-source machine learning (ML) operations (MLOps) framework that simplifies and streamlines the end-to-end ML workflow. It provides a robust and scalable platform to manage, orchestrate, and reproduce ML pipelines with a focus on reproducibility, collaboration, and automation.

## Key Features

- **Pipeline-Centric Workflows:** Define ML pipelines as a sequence of modular, reusable, and versioned components. Incorporate data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment stages into coherent and reproducible pipelines.

- **Reproducibility:** Ensure consistent and repeatable results by tracking and versioning the data, code, and configurations used in each pipeline run. Recreate any previous state of your ML pipeline for debugging, collaboration, and reproducing successful experiments.

- **Collaboration:** Seamlessly collaborate with data scientists, ML engineers, and other stakeholders. Share pipelines, integrate with version control, and track experiments to foster teamwork, knowledge sharing, and efficient communication.

- **Automation:** Streamline and scale your ML workflows with automation tools. Integrate with popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow and scikit-learn, and choose execution backends such as local, cloud-based platforms, or custom infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To get started with ZenML, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:** Install ZenML by running the following command:

```shell
pip install zenml
